# House_price_pridict


This is the House Price Prediction problem. The goal of this problem is to build a model that predicts house prices based on features such as Square footage, Bedrooms, Age, Floors, and Price. By using machine learning techniques, the model can learn from past data and make accurate predictions for the prices of houses that have not been previously priced.
